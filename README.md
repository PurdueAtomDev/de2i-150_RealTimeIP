The  project  operates  on  real-­‐time  video  and  performs  some  kind  of  image  processing.  Mainly,  it  bolds  the  edges,  and  changes  the  color  components  in  each  frame.  It  smoothens  each  frame  and  makes  it  brighter  and  blurred.  Overall,  it  modifies  the  image  to  make  it  look  like  a  painting  rather  than  a  normal  photograph.  An  interesting  challenge  involved  in  this  case  is  to  provide  processed  frames  on-­‐the-­‐fly  from  a  real-­‐time  video  feed.  The  output  is  displayed on the  monitor  through  VGA.
